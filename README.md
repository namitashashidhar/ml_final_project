# Automated Multi-Label Genre Classification of Movie Posters Using Deep Learning
This project automates the process of genre tagging for movies based on their posters using deep learning techniques. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, and DenseNet, the model classifies movie genres from images, handling multi-label classification. The system utilizes novel metrics like partial accuracy to improve performance, especially in cases with overlapping genres. The model was trained on a dataset of 7,968 movie posters and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, partial accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This approach can be beneficial for content recommendation systems, streaming platforms, and improving content discovery based on visual attributes in movie posters.
